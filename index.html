  <h3 id="theories">Popular Theories</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <u>The Bite of '87:</u> A theory suggests that
      the animatronic responsible for the Bite of '87 was
      actually Mangle, not Foxy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Phone Guy's Identity:</u> Some fans believe
      that Phone Guy is actually a former employee who
      survived an attack and is now guiding new night guards.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Multiple Timelines:</u> There is a theory
      that each game represents a different timeline,
      explaining inconsistencies in the lore.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Golden Freddy's Origins:</u> Some believe
      Golden Freddy is possessed by two children's spirits: Cassidy and the crying child from the fourth part of the franchise.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>The Puppet's Role:</u> A popular theory
      suggests that The Puppet is the key to understanding
      the entire FNAF lore, acting as a guardian for the
      children's souls.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Springtrap's Past:</u> Fans theorize that
      Springtrap is not just William Afton but also
      contains remnants of the souls of the children he
      harmed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>The Missing Children Incident:</u> Some
      theories propose that the incident involved more
      children than officially stated, leading to
      additional hauntings.
    </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Theory details</h3>
  <p>
     The most theories are based on minigames from the third part, including 
     those hidden minigames which are very important for understanding the depth and darkness of the FnaF's lore.
     In fact, this franchise couldn't be just a simple horror for kids. The game series is a real challenge for those 
     who like to think and find the most hidden meanings. Even after 12 years from the first release, the fans are still trying to find new theories and explanations for
     the mysteries of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. </p>
     <p> The most debated theories are those involving the Puppet and who Golden Freddy is possessed by. In our opinion, the crying child 
     could be in the Golden Freddy’s animatronic only because the "It's me text" which appears when he's with us in the security room. That 
     means that the crying child tries to talk to his brother Michael who technically killed him. s
